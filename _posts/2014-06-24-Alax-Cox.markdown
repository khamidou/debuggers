[Alan Cox tells the story of how he ported Linux to the m68k Macintosh](http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/docs/macpaper.php).

> This is when I first learned the horrors of the Mac. 
> While Unix says 'Im sorry you can't do that', MacOS has two error messages.

This was an error of the latter category.
