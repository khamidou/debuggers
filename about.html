<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I love reading debugging stories. This site is an attempt to read interesting stories on a regular basis.

<p>
Do you have an interesting story?
</p>

<p>
Whether you're working on video games, embedded software, webapps or enterprise software, I want to hear and publish it. <a href="mailto:karim@debuggers.co" class="important">Send me an email</a>.
</p>

<h2>Interview format</h2>

<p>
I always ask the same questions to my guests:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Who are you?</li>
    <li>What is the most interesting/funniest bug you've met?</li>
    <li>Anything else to add?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Apart from that, you've got <i>carte blanche</i>. It would help if you wrote your interview in Markdown though, but it's not mandatory.
</p>

<h2>Picture</h2>

<p>
I would also need a picture from you to illustrate the article. It has to be at least 550x550px. You don't have to figure on it if you don't want to.
</p>

<h2>Questions, remarks, contact</h2>
<p>
For anything else, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:karim@debuggers.co">send me an email</a>. I try my best to reply to every email.
