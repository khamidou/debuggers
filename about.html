<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I love reading debugging stories. This site is an attempt to read interesting stories on a regular basis. 
</p>

<h2>Submitting stories</h2>

<p>
Whether you're working on video games, embedded software, webapps or enterprise software, you probably have an interesting debugging story to tell. I want to publish it. <a href="mailto:karim@debuggers.co">Send me an email</a>.
</p>

<h2>Interview format</h2>

<p>
I always ask the same questions to my guests:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Who are you?</li>
    <li>What is the most interesting/funniest bug you've met?</li>
    <li>Anything else to add?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The rest is free-form.
