# About

I love reading debugging stories. This site is an attempt to read interesting stories on a regular basis. 

## Submitting stories

Whether you're working on video games, embedded software, webapps or enterprise software, you probably have an interesting debugging story to tell. I want to publish it. 

You can contact me at: `karim AT debuggers.co`

## Interview format

I always ask the same questions to my guests:

1. Who are you?
2. What is the most interesting/funniest bug you've met?
3. Anything else to add?

The rest is free-form.
